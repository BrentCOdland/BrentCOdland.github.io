In the unlikely event anyone will read this, hi! I've been meaning to start a website for my academic work for a while now. I looked into a number of simple solutions for webpages before I decided to start this one using Jekyll, hosted via github. I'm trying to learn about html, css, and javascript, so that hopefully I can take this a little bit further as my career grows (or fails..). In the meantime, this will be pretty boiler plate.
